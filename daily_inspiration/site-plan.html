        <h5>Quote from President Nelson</h5>
        <p>spiritual awareness

          President Nelson April 2018
          https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/04/revelation-for-the-church-revelation-for-our-lives?lang=eng
          “In coming days, it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost.
          My beloved brothers and sisters, I plead with you to increase your spiritual capacity to receive revelation.”
          </p>
          <h5>Quote from President Nelson</h5>
          <p>
          President Nelson April 2022
          https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/04/47nelson?lang=eng
          “We have never needed positive spiritual momentum more than we do now, to counteract the speed with which evil and the darker signs of the times are intensifying. Positive spiritual momentum will keep us moving forward amid the fear and uncertainty created by pandemics, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and armed hostilities. Spiritual momentum can help us withstand the relentless, wicked attacks of the adversary and thwart his efforts to erode our personal spiritual foundation.”
          </p>
          <h5>Quote from Elder Villar</h5>
          <p>
          Elder Juan Pablo Villar April 2019
          https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2019/04/52villar?lang=eng
          “Let’s accept the invitation of President Russell M. Nelson and intently come unto the Savior by identifying those muscles that need more spiritual activity and starting to exercise them. This is a long-distance race, a marathon, rather than a sprint, so do not forget those small but constant spiritual activities that will strengthen those important spiritual muscles. If we want to increase our faith, then let’s do things that require faith.”

      <h3>The Temple</h3>
      <h5>Quote from Elder Bednar</h5>
      <p>
        Elder Bednar October 2017
        https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2017/10/exceeding-great-and-precious-promises?lang=eng
        “Ordinances that are received worthily and remembered continually open the heavenly channels through which the power of godliness can flow into our lives. Covenants that are honored steadfastly and remembered always provide purpose and the assurance of blessings in both mortality and for eternity.”

      </p>
      <h5>Quote from Elder Eyring</h5>
      <p>
        Elder Eyring April 2021
        https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2021/04/17eyring?lang=eng
        “One of our greatest opportunities is when our family members are young. They are born with the Light of Christ as a gift. It enables them to sense what is good and what is evil. For that reason, even seeing a temple or a picture of a temple can cultivate in a child a desire to be worthy and privileged someday to go inside.”

      <h3>The Gathering of Israel</h3>
      <h5>Quote from Elder Bednar</h5>
      <p>
        Elder Bednar October 2018
        https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/10/gather-together-in-one-all-things-in-christ?lang=eng
        “I promise that increased perspective, purpose, and power will be evident in our learning and living of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ as we strive to gather together in one all things in Christ—even in Him.”
      </p>
      <h5>Quote from President Nelson</h5>
      <p>
        President Nelson October 2006
        https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2006/10/the-gathering-of-scattered-israel?lang=eng
        “The choice to come unto Christ is not a matter of physical location; it is a matter of individual commitment. People can be “brought to the knowledge of the Lord” without leaving their homelands. True, in the early days of the Church, conversion often meant emigration as well. But now the gathering takes place in each nation. The Lord has decreed the establishment of Zion in each realm where He has given His Saints their birth and nationality.”
